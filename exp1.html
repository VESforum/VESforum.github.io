            Reddit is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. 
            Reddit's registered community members can submit content, such as text posts or direct links.
            As of 2016, Reddit had 542 million monthly visitors (234 million unique users), 
            ranking #7 most visited web-site in US and #24 in the world.
            Across 2015, Reddit saw 82.54 billion pageviews, 73.15 million submissions, 725.85 million comments, and 6.89 billion upvotes from its users.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pros:</b>
            Reddit has something for everyone. Whether you enjoy being there, depends on what you want from the site. 
            If you are interested in news and politics, there are sub-reddits like World News and News, where you can find almost any kind of news from 
            all over world. If you are more into light stuff, you would probably want to explore funny. There are sub-reddits like Today I Learned (TIL) 
            where people share interesting but, not so well-known facts, Ask Reddit... where you can ask Redditors almost anything, and of course, 
            I Am A, where famous people like Barack Obama (Page on Reddit), Bill Gates (I’m Bill Gates), 
            Neil deGrasse Tyson (I am Neil deGrasse Tyson), etc. take time to personally answer questions asked by redditors. 
            That's a privilege you won't get anywhere. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            User cliques can quickly bury articles they don't agree with. Mostly unmoderated, so some titles could be not safe for work. Program support 
            Imgur links, Blog spam. Creepy things can be uploaded. It is not "safe" for kids. Reddit is the no-thrills version of social news. 
            It has a simple design that is easy to use, but it could also compete for one of the ugliest websites.

            Instagram is a mobile photo-sharing application and service that allows users to share pictures and videos either publicly or privately on 
            the service, as well as through a variety of other social networking platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and Flickr. 
            Originally, a distinctive feature was that it confined photos to a square shape, similar to Kodak Instamatic and Polaroid SX-70 images, 
            in contrast to the 4:3 aspect ratio typically used by mobile device cameras. In August 2015, version 7.5 was released for mobile devices, 
            allowing users to upload media captured in any aspect ratio, but not at full size. Users can also apply various digital filters to their 
            images. In June 2013, Instagram added support for videos, allowing prerecorded square standard definition resolution clips of up to 15 
            seconds to be shared; later updates introduced support for widescreen resolutions of up to 1080p and longer recording times for either pre 
            recorded (up to one minute) or disappearing live videos (up to one hour).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pros:</b>
            One of the greatest features of Instagram is its privacy settings. 
            This ensures that outside users--people who are not following you--have to request your permission to see your photos. 
            This helps ward off strangers and potential offenders who could possibly cause harm through their comments.
            When used safely, Instagram can be a positive, self-reinforcing application. 
            Likes and comments on a picture can help boost a child's self-esteem and make them more likely to maintain friendships. 
            It is also just one more way for children to keep in touch with long-distance friends and feel like the photographed events 
            in their life are important and worthy.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            Although the ability to tag a location can come in handy for businesses and those in charge of travel destinations, 
            it can be dangerous for minors. Location tags make it incredibly easy for a follower to find out exactly where and when a 
            picture was posted. As harmless as a location tag may seem to a child, predators and those with bad intentions can use them in the worst of ways.
            The rise of the quick photo sharing app Snapchat has prompted other mobile applications to follow suit. 
            Instagram now has a direct photo messaging feature that allows friends to Instagram private photos to one another. 
            This is a prime spot for sexting because it is a fairly new feature that many parents do not yet know about.

            XDA Developers (also known simply as XDA; often stylized as xda-developers) is a mobile software development 
            community of over 6.6 million members worldwide, started on 20 December 2002. 
            Although discussion primarily revolves around Android, members also talk about many other operating systems and mobile development topics.
            XDA-Developers.com (XDA Developers) was created by NAH6 Crypto Products BV (Netherlands). On 10 January 2011, 
            XDA-Developers was bought by JB Online Media, LLC (USA). 
            The name XDA Developers is originally derived from the O2 XDA, which was marketed as a personal digital assistant (PDA) with "extra" features.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Pros:</b>
            The site's main purpose is discussion, troubleshooting and development for Android, Sailfish OS, Windows Phone, 
            WebOS, Ubuntu Touch, Firefox OS and Tizen phones. 
            The site also offers Windows Mobile and Android users general information about devices, ROM upgrades, technical support, 
            Q&A, and reviews of device applications and accessories. 
            Separate forums exist for each model of phones manufactured by Micromax Mobile, Sony, HTC, Samsung, LG, Motorola, and many others. 
            Forums are also available for tablets and many other devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            It's hard to keep objectivity; for example, when someone asks something controversial and even though that someone knows it, 
            and wants opinions not taking in mind the subtleties, but wants ideas that tackle x dilemma or point, people rearrange the flow of 
            the forum by making drama or simply making obstacles.
            There's always the manic, rude guy that just spams with bad-words and superfluous content
            People don't realize whether the answer they write is really answering the question or just replying it
            It's not always exiged to reference the content one writes, so not all the info is always right or proven
            We regularly miss the intention of forums, making them more a group chat rather than a concrete idea-exchange way to approach topics. 
            It's cool to expose one's thoughts, but sometimes we tend to answer even the unnecesary "ok, thanks//I don't like that//why are you,,," 
            that makes forums' discussions look untidy or subjective.

            Fitness Blender was created by just two people; a husband and wife team of personal trainers who thought 
            fitness should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their income. 
            Both Kelli and Daniel felt like there was a lack of reliable health and fitness information on the web, and too many people in the 
            industry were more focused on monetary gain or appearance than they were on good health.

            <b>Pros:</b>Zumba, or any form of dance style class, will improve your agility and co-ordination, 
            with the inclusion of both the lower and upper body. You can definitely get your heart rate up 
            (improving cardiovascular fitness and health) but as with other exercise it will depend on how hard 
            you push yourself and how extravagant you make the movements.  
            It’s safe, achievable and often more enjoyable. A great option for beginners who would rather walk at a 
            moderate intensity for 30-60 minutes than train at high intensities for 30minutes.Personal diet profiles can be changed to fit a person’s 
            specific needs, whether they are on a strict diet or have certain recommendations from their doctor or dietitian. 
            The program calculates caloric need based on height, weight, gender, and lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Cons:</b>
            Some may argue that just counting calories is not the best or healthiest way to lose weight and to maintain a healthy life. 
            While basic science does say a calorie is a calorie is a calorie, there are other factors at play. 
            In other words, the fewer calories you eat, the more weight you’ll lose. 
            But there are several reasons why food choices should be based on other aspects – not just calories. Calorie counting seems to be the 
            most straightforward and easiest way to reach weight loss and/or health goals, but different types of food effect the body in various ways. 
            Some foods produce hormonal affects that store fat, release sugar, or build muscle. Two separate diets consisting of the same amount of 
            calories, but with different variations of fat, protein, and carbs, may have a much different satiety affect. That’s why it’s important to 
            focus on other parts of food, and not just the calories that come with it, in order to develop a proper eating plan. Under a more extreme light, 
            calorie counting can sometimes be detrimental to a person’s mental health. In fact, it is a typical fixation for people with eating disorders, a
            nd can make people make increasingly unnecessarily restricted food choices.
