                        <h3>What is IT Engineering?</h3>
                        <p class="grey">
                            IT engineering or Information Technology engineering is a broad definition that can apply to software engineering, 
                            hardware engineering, integration of hardware and software or validation and verification of hardware and software 
                            components. An IT engineer is equally responsible for hardware and software as well as their integration validation and testing.

                            IT industry is one of the fast growing fields in India. Fortunately people from other departments are also attracted to IT. 
                            Perhaps because of prospects of high salary and the exquisite offer provided. 
                            IT has a huge scope because it requires large technical manpower. 
                            Hence, many colleges and various departments related to this field are being encouraged. 
                            It is to be found that more than 2 million jobs are available yearly in IT field.

                        <h3>Bachelor of Information Technology</h3>
                        <p class="grey">
                            A Bachelor of Information Technology (abbreviations BIT, BInfTech, B.Tech(IT) or BE(IT)) is an undergraduate academic degree 
                            that generally requires three to five years of study.It is a sub branch of Computer Engineering. 
                            While the degree has a major focus on computers and technology, it differs from a Computer Science degree in that students 
                            are also expected to study management and information science, and there are reduced requirements for mathematics. 
                            A degree in computer science can be expected to concentrate on the scientific aspects of computing, while a degree in 
                            information technology can be expected to concentrate on the business and communication applications of computing. 
                            There is more emphasis on these two areas in the e-commerce, e-business and business information technology undergraduate courses.
